Civix is a command-line tool for building CiviCRM extensions. It is distributed as part of [CiviCRM-Buildkit](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-buildkit).

DO NOT MERGE

### Requirements

* PHP 7.1.3+
* CiviCRM 5.0+ (installed from git http://github.com/civicrm)
* (For MAMP, WAMP, XAMPP, etc) PHP command-line configuration (http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Setup+Command-Line+PHP)
* (For CentOS/RHEL) Compatible version of libxml2 (https://github.com/totten/civix/issues/19)

### Download: Single Executable

Civix is distributed as a single, portable PHAR executable.  As long as you have PHP-CLI
properly configured, it should work as a simple download, e.g.

```bash
sudo curl -LsS https://download.civicrm.org/civix/civix.phar -o /usr/local/bin/civix
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/civix
```

To upgrade an existing installation, simply re-download the latest `civix.phar`.

### Download: Git + Composer (Linux/OS X)

To download the source tree and all dependencies, use [`git`](https://git-scm.com) and [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/), e.g.:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/totten/civix
$ cd civix
$ composer install
```

### Download: Git + Composer (Windows)

```
# Install composer
In a browser, visit http://getcomposer.org
Click on the download button.
Scroll down to Windows Installer and click on Composer-Setup.exe.
Choose Run when prompted.

# Install git
If you don't already have git, then in a browser visit http://git-scm.com/download/win.
Choose Run when prompted.
Leave all the defaults.

# Download civix
Decide where you want to install civix. You might want to put it in C:\Program Files, but you might get hassled about admin rights, in which case you can pick somewhere else, like C:\users\<your name>.
From the start menu choose All Programs -> Git -> Git Bash.
In the window that appears, type:
  cd "/c/users/<your name>"
  (note the forward slashes)
git clone git://github.com/totten/civix.git
exit

# Download dependencies
In windows explorer, navigate to C:\users\<your name> (or whereever you installed civix).
Shift-right-click on the civix folder.
Choose open command window here.
In the window that appears, type:
  composer install

# Add civix to the PATH
Either temporarily add it:
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\users\<your name>\civix\bin

OR permanently:
Start Menu -> Control Panel -> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables
```

### Documentation

The [CiviCRM Developer Guide](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/) includes [tutorials for building extensions](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/extensions/civix/)

For reference documentation, civix supports a "--help" option.  For example,
to get reference materials about the "generate:page" command, run:

```bash
civix generate:page --help
```

### Development: Custom Build

If you are developing new changes to `civix` and want to create custom build of
`civix.phar` from source, you must have [`git`](https://git-scm.com), [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/), and
[`box`](http://box-project.github.io/box2/) installed. Then run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/totten/civix
...
$ cd civix
$ composer install
...
$ which box
/usr/local/bin/box
$ php -dphar.readonly=0 /usr/local/bin/box build
```

If you want to run with the same versions of PHP+box that are used for official builds, then run:

```
nix-shell --run ./build.sh
```

### Development: Testing

Automated testing for `civix` requires a live CiviCRM deployment -- where it can generate and install example extensions.  The deployment
must be amenable to CLI scripting (eg `civix`, `cv`, `civibuild`).  You should set the environment variable `CIVIX_WORKSPACE` to point to
a folder where we can safely fill+destroy extensions, such as:

```bash
export CIVIX_WORKSPACE=$HOME/buildkit/build/dmaster/web/sites/all/modules/civicrm/ext/civixtest
```

Tests are divided into a few areas:

* PHPUnit: End-to-end tests (`tests/e2e/**Test.php`)
* PHPUnit: Unit tests (`src/CRM/CivixBundle/**Test.php`)
* Snapshots: Library of example extensions (`tests/snapshots/*`)

### Development: Testing: PHPUnit

Ensure that the `CIVIX_WORKSPACE` is set before running phpunit. Also, ensure that there is clean database to test against.
For example:

```bash
export CIVIX_WORKSPACE=$HOME/buildkit/build/dmaster/web/sites/all/modules/civicrm/ext/civixtest
civibuild restore dmaster
phpunit8
```

The helper `./scripts/run-tests.sh` is a small wrapper which does the above.

### Development: Testing: Snapshots

Snapshots are extensions generated by historical versions of civix.  The library of snapshots is used for E2E testing.
Working with snapshots is also a handy way to evaluate patches and see how civix behaves. There are several
scripts for working with snapshots.

```bash
export CIVIX_WORKSPACE=$HOME/buildkit/build/dmaster/web/sites/all/modules/civicrm/ext/civixtest

## Look at available snapshots
ls tests/snapshots/

## Run "civix upgrade" against the existing snapshots.
## Optionally, you may filter by name and increase verbosity.
./scripts/upgrade-snapshots.sh
./scripts/upgrade-snapshots.sh /entity34/
./scripts/upgrade-snapshots.sh /v22.10.2-entity34/
DEBUG=2 ./scripts/upgrade-snapshots.sh /v22.10.2-entity34/

## Review the output of "civix upgrade"
cd tests/snapshots/*/*v22.10.2-entity34*
less upgrade.log
zipdiff original.zip upgrade | colordiff | less -R
cd ../../../..

## Make new extensions with the current civix source-code.
## Save the snapshots for us to inspect.
./scripts/make-snapshots.sh --src

## As above, but also install and test the snapshots.
./scripts/make-snapshots.sh --src --test

## Make new snapshots and save for future reference.
./scripts/make-snapshots.sh --src --version v99.88
git add tests/snapshots/*v99.88*

## Remove any temporary data generated by the above.
./scripts/tidy-snapshots.sh
```
